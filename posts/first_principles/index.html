Usually, first principles learning is emphasised in the STEM context, but theoretically it should hold for many more disciplines. Not only will the ideal first principles learner be able to ace conventional assessments, but more importantly, they will be able to see things that others might not. With great insight, can come great breakthroughs, and these can manifest in the form of scientific discoveries or impactful companies.\nWhat‚Äôs missing in the conversation From my perspective as a first year medical student, the gap in the conversation is how first principles learning can be routinely applied to the study of life sciences. Biology and medicine is often notorious for being content-heavy, and thus supposedly impervious to decomposition by first principles thinking. So, recently, I‚Äôve been playing around with what learning approach designed with first principles at its core might look like.\nA super high level framework to use A theoretical guide to using first principles learning for life sciences\nStart by understanding what first principles learning is. For our sake, it is a way of thinking which seeks to strip away unnecessary assumptions from whatever problem you‚Äôre up against and reason instead from more solid ground.\nCreate some terms to shape knowledge. Imagine everything you learn about the human body: haematology, pathology, immunity, psychology ‚Ä¶ can be decomposed into nodes and links. Let‚Äôs consider knowledge to be a node and relationships between nodes to be links. For instance‚Ä¶\nNode: A CD4 cell is a cell which helps coordinate immune responses is a node representing a unit of knowledge.\nNode: A B cell is a cell which can produce antibodies is another node of knowledge.\nLink: Now, the understanding that a CD4 cell can activate a B cell through its TCR and co-stimulation and cytokines is a link between two nodes. (although a different model could propose that this is a node in itself)\nSo the focus then of learning is to breakdown every concept that needs to be learned into nodes and links, and use these models to guide you in your assessments (e.g. MCQ, SA, essays).\n‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs [insert objection]‚Äù Some reasonable objections:\nIsn‚Äôt this how everything is taught? What‚Äôs the difference between first principles and non-first principles thinking?\nThat‚Äôs right! Of course the node vs link relationship can be blurry, but broadly speaking everything taught through lectures can be broken down into nodes and links. The question with first principles pedagogy is how can we break down the knowledge medical students need into just the core fundamental relationships, from which more granular knowledge and insight can be derived.\nHow can nodes and links help me answer things like MCQ? It seems like a concept which is just adding unnecessary structure and clutter to my learning.\nPractical example from college student pov Let‚Äôs take the MCQ question below as an example.\nQuestion 1 : Anatomy #1\nTo get to the right answer most effectively, student would ideally be able to know or reason out why each statement is true or false.\nI‚Äôm proposing first principles learning is learning just enough to be able to know why the wrong answers are wrong, or at least to know why the right answer is correct.\nTake the last statement:\nD. Elastic arteries are closest to the heart, whereas muscular arteries are further away.\nThe minimum amount of information required to ascertain that this is the correct answer could take the following chain of nodes and links:\n  Node: Heart pumps blood\n  Node (principle): Speed of blood flow decreases as you move away from the pump\n  Node: An artery is a tube\n  Link: Blood is pumped out of the heart through arteries\n  Link: Elastic arteries are the most flexible arteries with the greatest diameters\n  Node (principle): More flexible tubes with wider diameters can sustain greater pump speed\n  Node (principle): Structures in the human body are usually there for a very specific reason and design (e.g. if it wasn‚Äôt effective and useful it would likely not be there).\n  Conclusion: Reasoning from 1 to 7 means that it makes sense that D would be correct.\nEven more qualifications No doubt there are countless other ways to reason that D would be the correct answer, but I hope the above example gives a nice overview to what first principles learning may look like and be applied in practice. The goal for the learner would be to break down what they are learning into discrete links and nodes, and then the bulk of revision would be to figure out how these links and nodes interact with each other through exposure to different learning activities.\nThe alternative to first principles is memorisation, which is memorising that D is the answer. Most people are a blend of memorising and first principles reasoning. However few people explicitly seek to get first principle understanding, this is where the advantage of a first principles focused approach may come in.\nBottom line TLDR; first principles is reasoning from minimum amount of information. Learning through first principles is making explicit the relationships (links) between different bites of knowledge (nodes), guided by principles (important nodes).\nNow, wouldn‚Äôt it be interesting if there was a service that decomposed all the information medical students needed in an easily searchable way ‚Ä¶ ü§î\n","wordCount":"944","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2021-06-13T20:39:32+10:00","dateModified":"2021-06-13T20:39:32+10:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Haotian Huang"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://haotianhuang.github.io/posts/first_principles/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"HH ü§î","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://haotianhuang.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add('dark'):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove('dark'):window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches&&document.body.classList.add('dark')</script><noscript><style type=text/css>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:#1d1e20;--entry:#2e2e33;--primary:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.84);--secondary:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.56);--tertiary:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.16);--content:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.74);--hljs-bg:#2e2e33;--code-bg:#37383e;--border:#333}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://haotianhuang.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Haotian Huang (Alt + H)">Haotian Huang</a>
